*Social Connect* is a frontend-only personal project designed to replicate the modern feel of social media platforms like Instagram. I started with an online template, then customized, rebranded, and redesigned it to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

This project showcases my frontend skills, design intuition, and creative modifications using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript.
